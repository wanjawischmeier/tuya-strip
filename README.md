# Tuya Outlet CLI

A simple Python CLI to control a Tuya-compatible 3-way smart power strip **over your local network** without using the Tuya cloud (except once during setup). Basically just a simple wrapper around the awesome [tinytuya](https://github.com/jasonacox/tinytuya) project.

## Features
- Turn each plug **on/off** individually
- Show status including plug states and energy data (voltage, current, power)
- Simple setup command for device configuration
- Robust configuration management with timeout and retry options

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install tuya-strip
```

### Option 2: Install from Source

1. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

2. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wanjawischmeier/tuya-strip.git
cd tuya-strip
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

## Setup

Configure your device credentials:
```bash
tuya-strip setup
```

The setup command will prompt you to enter your device details:
- Device ID
- Device IP address
- Local Key
- Protocol Version (default: 3.3)

Configuration is saved to your home directory (`~/.tuya-strip`) and will work from any directory.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you installed from source, prefix all commands with `poetry run` (e.g., `poetry run tuya-strip setup`)

## Usage

```bash
tuya-strip status                    # Show current state and energy data
tuya-strip on 1                      # Turn on plug 1
tuya-strip off 3                     # Turn off plug 3
tuya-strip --timeout 5 status        # Use custom timeout
tuya-strip --retries 5 on 2          # Use custom retry count
```

## Example Output
```yaml
Loading config from: C:\Users\username\.tuya-strip
Switches: {'1': True, '2': False, '3': True}
Energy: {'voltage_V': 229, 'current_mA': 120, 'power_W': 24}
```
